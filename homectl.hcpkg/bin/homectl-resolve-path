"""
This is a little utility program that acts like Linux's "readlink -f" on
steroids.

It has two jobs:

- In its one-parameter form, it takes a path and turns it into an absolute path
  with no symlinks.  In this mode it behaves exactly like a cross-platform
  readlink -f.

- In its two-parameter form, it takes a path and turns it into a relative path,
  relative to some other, specified path (NOT pwd, unless you say "."), again
  removing all the symlinks.

It's a good tool to use for creating symlinks, where you want a relative link,
but you only know the target in absolute terms or relative to a different
directory.
