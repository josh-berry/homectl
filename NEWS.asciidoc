News for homectl
================

:toc:

Version 0.2.0
-------------

Released on: 22-Jul-2013

.Incompatible Changes

* `homectl enable` and `homectl disable` now take package paths instead of just
  the basename.  This allows you to have multiple packages in different
  directories with the same name, and it makes enabling/disabling packages more
  convenient since you can use Tab-completion.

* `homectl list` now shows the full path to each enabled package, so you know
  exactly what is enabled and where it lives.

.New Features

* Homectl now understands Emacs.
  ** Add `emacs.el` files to your homectl packages to load and configure your
     Emacs packages.
  ** Automatically install packages from ELPA and other `package` archives with
     `homectl-require`.

* The new `homectl find` command locates files with a particular name in enabled
  packages, and echoes their paths.

.Bugs Fixed

* The `deploy.sh` script generated by `homectl init` now properly initializes
  git submodules in freshly-cloned setups.

  ** Existing homectl setups need to have their `deploy.sh` scripts corrected by
     hand.  Change your `deploy.sh` to call
     `git submodule update --init --recursive`
     instead of just `git submodule update`.
